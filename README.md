It has 3 navigation options, add a new product, delete or "sell" a product and search for products

Totally functionable search bar as well paired with a "type" selector, so in this next image is selected as default so every kind of product is shown

But we can select other kind of product that is stored in the database

The selling or deletion of prouduct is pretty much similar, having a product sold message

Then last but not least a menu where you can add the new product, which its modifiable so it can now store more kinds of products but thats depending of client and what does it require, mine only desired few types
